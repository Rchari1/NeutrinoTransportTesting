# Computational Astrophysics Group - NeutrinoTransport Test Repository
### This GitHub repository serves as a test environment for the NeutrinoTransport code developed by the Computational Astrophysics Group. It also provides a general organizational structure for the group's computational astrophysics projects.

## NeutrinoTransport Code
### The NeutrinoTransport code is a computational astrophysics code used for simulating the transport of neutrinos through astrophysical environments. The code is written in C++ and has been optimized for high-performance computing architectures.

## Dependencies
### The NeutrinoTransport code requires the following dependencies:

* C++11-compatible compiler (e.g., GCC 4.8 or later, Clang 3.3 or later)
