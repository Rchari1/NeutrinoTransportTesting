Open Terminal.

Navigate to the location of your Git repository.


First give command:
$ touch .gitignore

If the command succeeds, there will be no output.

If you want to ignore a file that is already checked in, you must untrack the file 
before you add a rule to ignore it. From your terminal, untrack the file.

$ git rm --cached FILENAME

ex: git rm --cached Output/PlotFile_*

ex: git rm --cached Output/ -r

Now open the file using 

$  vim .git/info/exclude

and add all the things you want to ignore. Here are mine:

Output
Output/PlotFile_*
simulation_log.txt
FENN
