Hello! 

This is a document intended to be an on boarding guide to information regarding the FERN/FENN research group. 

Description of FERN:
https://github.com/FERNmatrix/Thermo-nuclear-network.git
This is a Thermo-nuclear-network code that simulates the evolution of nuclear species in astrophysicaly significant conditions. There is a markdown file names README that has description of all primary files. 

Description of FENN: 
https://github.com/Rchari1/FENN.git
This is compile simulation that evolves neutrino energy specter of a population of neutrinos under physical condition that are emblematic of type two core collapse super nova.  

Description of Testing Repo(this repository):
This is a testing repository intended for all useful tools regarding the FENN code. It is intended for documenting development, storing debugging tools, and plotting scripts.
